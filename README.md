# Web-based Text Question Answering with LangChain
This project is a web application that enables users to extract text from a specified URL and ask questions about the content. Utilizing LangChain and OpenAI's language model, the application processes web text and generates answers based on user queries.

# Features
          URL Input: Enter a URL to fetch and extract text from a web page.
          
          Content Processing: Automatically retrieves and processes paragraphs from the web page.
          
          Question Answering: Ask questions related to the fetched content, and receive answers generated by an AI model.
          
          Text Chunking: Splits large text into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
          
          Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
